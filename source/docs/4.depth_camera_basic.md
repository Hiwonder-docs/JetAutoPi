# 4. ROS2-Depth Camera Basic Course

## 4.1 Depth Camera Configuration

:::{Note}

* This document uses Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS2 Foxy as examples for installation. The system and ROS versions should not be lower than Ubuntu 20.04 and ROS2 Foxy, as software versions below these are outdated. Using outdated software means you will not receive security and maintenance updates, and compatibility issues will pose significant challenges, potentially leading to unsolvable problems.

* Before starting the configuration, please install virtual machine software and import Ubuntu 20.04.

* Next, install ROS Foxy. Refer to "Install and Configure ROS2" in the same path as this document. This document will not provide further details on the aforementioned installations.

  :::

### 4.1.1 Install and Configure ROS2

:::{Note}

The virtual machine system image provided already has the ROS2 environment configured. This step is for reference only.

:::

(1) Before starting this course, please refer to "Linux Basic Course\->3. Linux Installation and Source Replacement" to install the virtual machine client and import the ROS2 Ubuntu image (the official image is located in the "6 Virtual Machines\ubuntu_ros2_humble" folder).

(2) The image file we provide is in the "[Appedix->ubuntu_ros2_humble]()" folder, and the ROS2 environment is already configured. Users can refer to this section for a brief overview of the ROS2 system installation and environment setup.

This tutorial must be used in a virtual machine. The camera functionality package is already configured on the robot, so please do not reconfigure it on the camera.

### 4.1.2 Version Options

Different versions of ROS2 are installed on different versions of Ubuntu. In this section, we will use the virtual machine with Ubuntu 20.04, which corresponds to ROS2 Foxy.

### 4.4.4 LDP Protection

LDP protection typically refers to '**Lens Data Protection**' in the context of cameras. It is designed to protect the camera lens from accidental damage or impact. With the DaBai camera, if an object gets too close, the infrared camera will automatically shut down. The shutoff distance depends on the intensity of reflected light. We can enable or disable LDP protection according to our needs.

(1) Run the command to turn on the camera.

```
ros2 launch orbbec_camera dabai.launch.py
```

(2) Open a new terminal, and execute the command to initiate the image viewing tool.

```
rqt
```

The appearance of the interface in the following image indicates successful opening.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_4\section_1\media\image64.png"  />

Choose ‘**Plugins\>Visualization\>ImageView**’.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_4\section_1\media\image65.png"  />

Set the red box location to the content in the image below:

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_4\section_1\media\image67.png"  />

When the object reaches a certain distance from the camera, the depth map will transition to black.

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_4\section_1\media\image75.png"  />

(3) Open a new command-line terminal, and execute the command to close LDP protection.

```
ros2 service call /camera/set_ldp_enable std_srvs/srv/SetBool data:\ false
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_4\section_1\media\image76.png"  />

At this stage, the image remains visible even as an object approaches the camera.

(4) Execute the command to initiate LDP protection.

```
ros2 service call /camera/set_ldp_enable std_srvs/srv/SetBool data:\ true
```

<img class="common_img" src="../_static/media/chapter_4\section_1\media\image77.png"  />

## 4.5 Data Type and Point Cloud

### 4.5.1 Introduction to Point Cloud

The things we observe with our eyes are three-dimensional, but in computer vision, using regular cameras only provides two-dimensional information about an object, which cannot achieve the same observation effect as human eyes. In order for computers to represent three-dimensional objects, computer vision needs to transition into three-dimensional vision, and point clouds are the way to express three-dimensional vision.

### 4.5.2 Understanding Point Cloud Data Types

Point cloud data refers to a collection of vectors in a three-dimensional coordinate system, typically expressed in the X, Y, and Z axes of the three-dimensional coordinate system. It is commonly used to represent the surface shape of an object. Point cloud data can also represent attributes such as RGB colors, grayscale values, depth, etc., of an object's surface.

Robot point cloud data is acquired through LiDAR and depth cameras, both of which are capable of measurements.

Common formats for storing point cloud data include pts, asc, dat, stl, imw, xyz, txt, csv, etc. Point cloud data, much like an attribute table, records the X, Y, Z positions of corresponding points along with various attributes associated with each point.

### 4.5.3 Point Cloud
